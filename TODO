Specific TODO resulting from #1 above
=====================================
1) I'd like it if the hosts line was optional in the ansible stanzas (NOTE: it might actually be...need to test it)
2) Files section should have a way to do parameter substitution in transferred files

Tests
=====
1) scripts that can run remotely
2) scripts that run locally
3) scripts that run locally against pre-defined input (`ps auxwww`, `dpkg -l`, etc)
4) simple checks for the presence of a file, something listening on a port, a port being open to the local machine

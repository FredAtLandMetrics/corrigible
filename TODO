1) Try to use for real world uses
2) Write tests based on failures
3) Make tests pass
4) Repeat

Specific TODO resulting from #1 above
=====================================
1) inline ansible plans
  problem: it's a bit more tedious than it needs to be to use files because you
           end up having to reference an ansible file to do anything interesting
  solution: inline ansible stanzas in plan files (and system files)
2) I'd like it if the hosts line was optional in the ansible stanzas
3) Files sections in plans lists need to have parameter capability so that I can define key/val pairs that apply to every file in the list

Big Picture
===========
1) in the plan and system files, shorten to src and dst

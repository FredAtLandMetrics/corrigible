General TODO
============
1) Try to use for real world uses
2) Write tests based on failures
3) Make tests pass
4) Repeat
5) Parallelize over equal priorities

Specific TODO resulting from #1 above
=====================================
1) inline ansible plans (status: created system file for testing)
  problem: it's a bit more tedious than it needs to be to use files because you
           end up having to reference an ansible file to do anything interesting
  solution: inline ansible stanzas in plan files (and system files)
2) I'd like it if the hosts line was optional in the ansible stanzas (NOTE: it might actually be...need to test it)
3) Files sections in plans lists need to have parameter capability so that I can define key/val pairs that apply to every file in the list (status: created system file for testing)

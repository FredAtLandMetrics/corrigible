General TODO
============
1) Try to use for real world uses
2) Write tests based on failures
3) Make tests pass
4) Repeat
5) Parallelize over equal priorities
6) Add tests!

Specific TODO resulting from #1 above
=====================================
1) rocket mode is currently a little broken.  What needs to happen is that, when it is determined that a given plan needs to run, corrigible needs to remove the calling plan from the hashed list otherwise a changed plan three, four or five layers deep will never get called.
2) I'd like it if the hosts line was optional in the ansible stanzas (NOTE: it might actually be...need to test it)

Tests
=====
1) scripts that can run remotely
2) scripts that run locally
3) scripts that run locally against pre-defined input (`ps auxwww`, `dpkg -l`, etc)
4) simple checks for the presence of a file, something listening on a port, a port being open to the local machine

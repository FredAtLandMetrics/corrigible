General TODO
============
1) Try to use for real world uses
2) Write tests based on failures
3) Make tests pass
4) Repeat

Specific TODO resulting from #1 above
=====================================
1) implement subdirs in machines, directives, and files
  * for machines and directives, files in subdirs will be treated as if they are
    in the top-level directories
  * files in subdirs will be referenced by paths relative to toplevel files dir
2) inline ansible directives
  problem: it's a bit more tedious than it needs to be to use files because you
           end up having to reference an ansible file to do anything interesting
  solution: inline ansible stanzas in directive files (and machine meta files)
3) I'd like it if the hosts line was optional in the ansible stanzas
4) Files sections in directives lists need to have parameter capability so that I can define key/val pairs that apply to every file in the list

Big Picture
===========
1) rename .directive.yml to .plan.yml
2) refer 'plans' not directives in code
3) rename .meta.yml to .system.yml
4) refer to 'systems' and not 'machines'
5) in the plan and system files, shorten to src and dst
6) in the plan and system files, instead of directives/directive do plan/item
